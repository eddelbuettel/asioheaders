Description: 'Asio' is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level
 I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent asynchronous model
 using a modern C++ approach.
 .
 'Asio' is also included in Boost but requires linking when used with
 Boost. Standalone it can be used header-only provided a recent-enough
 compiler. 'Asio' is written and maintained by Christopher M. Kohlhoff.
 'Asio' is released under the 'Boost Software License', Version 1.0.
 .
 This package is a pure installer which downloads the actual 'Asio' headers
 when it is built, and does not contain any 'Asio' content in its sources
 when present on CRAN.  As such, this pure R package is released under the
 GNU GPL, Version 2 or later.
