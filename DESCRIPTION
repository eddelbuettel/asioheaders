Description: 'Asio' is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level
 I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent asynchronous model
 using a modern C++ approach. It is also included in Boost but requires linking
 when used with Boost. Standalone it can be used header-only (provided a recent
 compiler). 'Asio' is written and maintained by Christopher M. Kohlhoff, and
 released under the 'Boost Software License', Version 1.0.
