Description: 'Asio' is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level
 I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent asynchronous model
 using a modern C++ approach.
 .
 'Asio' is also included in Boost but requires linking when used with
 Boost. Standalone it can be used header-only provided a recent-enough
 compiler. 'Asio' is written and maintained by Christopher M. Kohlhoff.
 .
 This package is a pure installer which downloads the actual Asio headers
 when it is built, and does not contain any Asio content in its sources.
